### Introduction
Earn's is a unique storytelling platform where creativity and imagination meet interactive reading. It offers a universe of engaging articles, comic-style stories, and vivid narratives. Perfect for parents to read as a saga or in the stories folder, and also to read about other topics like news, history, or religion. The platform targets two groups: the Superuser, who can quickly create stories for the user, resulting in numerous articles and stories, and the user who reads perhaps for themselves or their children. The platform maintains a neutral stance on political or religious thoughts, catering to a world that really needs it.

### Design
Earn's design embraces a comic book aesthetic with a modern twist, ensuring an immersive reading experience. The platform is built with the user in mind, focusing on simplicity and ease of navigation.

#### Colour Scheme
![Colour Palette](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxr3hsus/image/upload/v1702813191/themecolor_earns_jf2ewk.png)
The colour palette is a mix of earthy tones and vibrant highlights, creating a balance between comfort and excitement.

#### Typography
We use a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts to delineate between story narration and user interface elements.

#### Wireframes
![Wireframes color and inspiration](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxr3hsus/image/upload/v1703507093/Sk%C3%A4rmbild_2023-12-25_132358_cunbld.png)
Wireframes for Earn's were developed to plan the layout and user flow for both desktop and mobile views. After deciding on the desired design, AI was used to create an inspirational layout, which has been the basis for the work.

### Scrum - Progress

[The Issues](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxr3hsus/image/upload/v1703510074/Sk%C3%A4rmbild_2023-12-25_140621_plc989.png)
The issues are organized without specific milestones since the goals were obvious. As a MVP, some issues may be left for future work. They are labeled for easy identification. The PRIO label indicates priority tasks.

[The Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzxr3hsus/image/upload/v1703510073/Sk%C3%A4rmbild_2023-12-25_140523_k80fjf.png)
The dashboard currently displays: In Progress, PRIO, Testing, and "Won't Fix or Future Feature". The Todo category has been removed since all issues have been started. It will be added again when new tasks arise.

### Credits
Earn's is not just a platform but a community, and it wouldn't be possible without the contributions from our readers and writers alike. A special thank you to:
- **Contributors:** To all the wonderful people who have invested time in making Earn's rich with content.
- **Code Institute:** For providing the knowledge base to embark on building this project.
- **Udemy Course:** Python Django - The Practical Guide by Maximilian Schwarzmüller
- **Udemy Course:** Mega Web Development Course: Full stack web application 2023 by Pouya Eli
- **Christoffer Hurtig:** A good friend who has guide me thru problems when I have been stuck or searching for sulotions for features.
- **My Girlfriend:** Who has been very supporting ang given me time to work on the project even on christmas eve. And made miricals at home with the kids while i have been stuck with the project.

All these contributors have inspired the project and helped me build the project as it is.

### The End Story
This project has truly been a challenge. Initially, I admit I despised Django, as I couldn't quite grasp it and saw only limitations. However, through Code Institute's instructional videos and some preliminary projects I worked on, my perspective shifted. Today, I appreciate Django immensely and could even envision working with it on a daily basis.

Working on this school project, my primary focus was learning. Without a deadline, I believe my approach would have been different. My innate tendency to invent and create constantly leads me to think of more and more functions. This experience has clarified my future career aspirations. I've learned a great deal about organizing work theoretically, but in practice, without colleagues, this organization served mainly as a tool at the beginning and end of the work process.

Initially, my goal was to become a full-stack developer, and I still adhere to that. However, it's the project management and backend development that truly ignite my passion. My interest in design is practical. I believe I am better suited to work on ideas and functions. AI has also been a key focus in my work, and I've concluded that it will be an essential resource in my future endeavors. The AI available today requires knowledge of its capabilities and understanding of how and when to make specific requests. I feel increasingly proficient in this area.

Without a doubt, AI will be a faithful companion throughout my career. With the knowledge I've already gained in using it, I believe my skills will grow rapidly. Project 4 has been incredibly developmental and gratifying. Although time hasn't been on my side, I hope that a discerning reader can see the awareness and understanding in my work.
